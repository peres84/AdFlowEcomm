| Provider      | Max Duration           | Description |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **OpenAI**    | Not publicly specified | Major AI research lab. On Runware it provides video models, but specific durations aren’t clearly documented. |
| **Wan**       | Not publicly specified | Likely a model supplier (possibly Chinese market). Details on duration and specific versions are scarce. |
| **Lightricks**| Not publicly specified | Known for creative media tools (e.g., mobile apps). Duration limits not clearly shown. |
| **MiniMax**   | 6 s (some models) / up to 10 s (Hailuo 02) | “Hailuo” series supports text-to-video and image-to-video workflows. Advanced models allow 10 s videos. |
| **KlingAI**   | 10 s                  | Many versions (Standard, Pro, Master) supporting text-to-video and image-to-video workflows in HD. |

## Key Takeaways

- Among the listed providers, **KlingAI**, **ByteDance**, and **MiniMax (advanced version)** support the **longest durations** (up to 10 s).  
- Providers with unspecified durations (OpenAI, Wan, Lightricks, Runway) require checking the specific model version on Runware.  
- For durations longer than 10 s, some models (like KlingAI) may allow extensions in blocks depending on plan and version.
